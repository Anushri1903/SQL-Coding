# SQL-Coding-

The basic and advanced concepts of SQL using Postgres in this repository. 
I have also worked upon data cleaning, and manipulation and analysis over a few case studies. 

The case studies are done using following basis techniques of SQl and I am actively learning advanced skillset in SQL for Data Analyst.

Data generation - create, update
Data Manipulation - where, group by , order by 
Discreptive Statistics  - Aggregation function avg, sum, stddev_pop, var_pop
Table Joins-  (Inner, Left, Right, Outer and Cross)
Conditional statements using case statements and if-else statements
Window functions (row_number(), rank(),dense_rank)
Rank(), Row_number() or Dense_rank()
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
