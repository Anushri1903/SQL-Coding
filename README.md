# SQL-Coding-

The basic and advanced concepts of SQL using Postgres in this repository. 
I have also worked upon data cleaning, and manipulation and analysis over a few case studies. 

The case studies are done using following basis techniques of SQl and I am actively learning advanced skillset in SQL for Data Analyst.

1. Data generation - create, update
2. Data Manipulation - where, group by , order by 
3. Discreptive Statistics  - Aggregation function avg, sum, stddev_pop, var_pop
4. Table Joins-  (Inner, Left, Right, Outer and Cross)
5. Conditional statements using case statements and if-else statements
6. Window functions (Rank(), Row_number() or Dense_rank())
7. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
8. Views and Temporary tables
9. String and datetime manipulation
